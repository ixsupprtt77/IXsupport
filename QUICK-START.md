# ‚ö° QUICK DEPLOYMENT STEPS

## ‚úÖ CODE PUSHED SUCCESSFULLY!

Your code has been pushed to: https://github.com/ixsupprtt77/IXsupport

---

## üöÄ COMPLETE THESE 3 FINAL STEPS:

### STEP 1: Enable GitHub Pages (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/ixsupprtt77/IXsupport/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions" from dropdown
3. The workflow will automatically start deploying!

### STEP 2: Configure Custom Domain (2 minutes)

In the same page (still in Pages settings):

1. Under "Custom domain":
   - Enter: `ixsupports.com`
   - Click "Save"
2. Wait for DNS check (you'll see a checkmark when ready)
3. Enable "Enforce HTTPS" once DNS is verified

### STEP 3: Update Your Domain DNS Records

At your domain registrar (where you bought ixsupports.com):

**Add these A Records:**
```
Type: A
Host: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Host: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Host: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A  
Host: @
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

**Add CNAME Record for www:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Value: ixsupprtt77.github.io
```

## üìä CHECK DEPLOYMENT STATUS

1. Go to: https://github.com/ixsupprtt77/IXsupport/actions
2. You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Wait for green checkmark ‚úÖ (1-2 minutes)
4. Your site will be live!

---

## üåê YOUR WEBSITE WILL BE AT:

- **Custom Domain**: https://ixsupports.com (after DNS propagates)
- **GitHub Pages**: https://ixsupprtt77.github.io/IXsupport (available immediately)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. **First deployment**: Takes 2-3 minutes after enabling GitHub Actions
2. **DNS propagation**: Can take 5 minutes to 24 hours (usually fast)
3. **Test first** with GitHub Pages URL, then custom domain
4. **Clear cache** if you see white screen: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
